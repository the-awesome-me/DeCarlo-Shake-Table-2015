# DeCarlo-Shake-Table-2015
This is the repository for all code related to Ms. DeCarlo's Shake Table at St. Simon School. This includes both the Java code and the Arduino code.
Please only make changes if you are Bella Piagentini or Kevin Gottlieb, seriously. I will hate you forever if you change ANYTHING and you are not one of these people.
